This is an extension for Tk40*.* (and maybe Tk800.*) which supplies
TIFF format loader for Photo image type. The TIFF code is stolen from
.../pTk/mTk/additions/imgTIFF.c from the perl/Tk distribution.

Installation:

You need libtiff (ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/) and probably libjpeg
(ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/) installed on your system.

Check Makefile.pl for appropriate library and include paths and
library names. Then build the extension by typing:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The module is only tested on FreeBSD-2.2.1 with the following
configuration:
* perl 5.004_04
* Tk 402.004
* tiff 3.4
* jpeg 6a
