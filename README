This is an extension for Tk40*.* (and maybe Tk800.*) which supplies
TIFF format loader for Photo image type. The TIFF code is stolen from
.../pTk/mTk/additions/imgTIFF.c from the perl/Tk distribution.

Installation:

You need an libtiff and libjpeg installed on your system.

Check Makefile.pl for appropriate library and include paths and
library names. Then build the extension by typing:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
